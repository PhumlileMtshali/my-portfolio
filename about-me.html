    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1><br>
    <p>A self-driven, enthusiastic, and hardworking young woman with a very excellent work ethic, problem solving skills and very optimistic.<br>
       I'm currently a student at GirlCode where I'm training to become a full-stack web developer. So far, I’ve completed modules in HTML and <br>
     CSS, and I’m currently learning JavaScript and expanding my skills every day as I build real web projects and improve my understanding<br> of how the web works.<br><br>
    <p>Before transitioning into tech, I earned a degree in Biological Sciences. Although I started in the sciences, I found myself increasingly drawn<br>
    to the creativity and logic involved in coding. I decided to follow that passion and take a leap into web development a space where I can<br> 
    combine analytical thinking with problem-solving and creativity. My background has taught me how to approach challenges with curiosity <br> and persistence, 
    and now I’m applying those strengths to tech. I’m passionate about learning, growing, and building websites and apps that solve<br> real-world problems 
    especially ones that make everyday tasks simpler and more accessible.</p><br><br>
